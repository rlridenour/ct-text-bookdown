Determining validity is only half of the task of evaluating an argument. As we've seen, a valid argument can still be very bad. Here's a valid argument:

<ul class="list-arg">
1. If I tossed heads with that coin, then the world will end tomorrow.
2. <u>I tossed heads with that coin.</u>
3. The world will end tomorrow.
</ul>

No one should take this argument to be evidence for an impending apocalypse.
